echo "   a) Go to your frontend application"
echo "   b) Login as a teacher"
echo "   c) Create a new homework with class grade 'Grade 4'"
echo "   d) Check if you receive emails as a student"
echo "   e) Check the backend console for logs"

echo "4. Expected behavior after fix:"
echo "   - Homework created with 'Grade 4'"
echo "   - System converts 'Grade 4' to '4th Grade'"
echo "   - Finds 3 students with '4th Grade'"
echo "   - Sends emails to all 3 students"
echo "   - Backend logs show conversion process"

echo "   - Check backend console for any errors"
echo "   - Verify email configuration is correct"
echo "   - Check if there are any email sending exceptions"
echo "   - Ensure the backend is actually running our new code"
