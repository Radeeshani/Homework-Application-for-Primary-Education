- `GET /api/homework/calendar/test` ✅ - Calendar test endpoint

### 3. Database Integration - WORKING ✅
- Classes table populated with sample data
- Teacher information properly linked
- All CRUD operations ready

## ✅ Frontend Testing - COMPLETED

### 1. Component Compilation ✅

- No syntax errors or import issues
- Build process completes without errors

### 2. Component Structure ✅

- Active route highlighting

## 🧪 Manual Testing Required

### 1. Frontend Functionality Testing
- [ ] Open `http://localhost:3000` in browser
- [ ] Login as different user roles (Teacher, Student, Admin)
- [ ] Test navigation menu visibility based on role
- [ ] Navigate to class management pages
- [ ] Test class creation form (teachers/admins)
- [ ] Test class viewing (all users)
- [ ] Test search and filtering
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile

### 2. User Experience Testing
- [ ] Verify beautiful UI with gradients and animations
- [ ] Test hover effects and transitions
- [ ] Verify form validation and error handling
- [ ] Test modal functionality
- [ ] Verify responsive grid layouts

### 3. Integration Testing
- [ ] Verify frontend can fetch data from backend
