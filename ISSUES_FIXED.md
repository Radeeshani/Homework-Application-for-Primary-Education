# Issues Fixed - LearnHub

## Summary of Problems and Solutions

### 1. ✅ Missing Vite.svg Favicon (404 Error)
**Problem**: The frontend was trying to load `/vite.svg` which didn't exist, causing a 404 error.

**Solution**: Created a proper Vite SVG favicon in `frontend/public/vite.svg`.

### 2. ✅ Authentication Failures (401/500 Errors)
**Problem**: The demo users in the database had placeholder password hashes that couldn't be validated, causing login failures.

**Root Cause**: The `demo_users.sql` file contained placeholder BCrypt hashes like `$2a$10$example.hash.admin` which are invalid.

**Solution**: 
- Created a utility to generate proper BCrypt password hashes
- Generated working hashes for all demo passwords
- Created `cleanup_and_populate.sql` that properly handles foreign key constraints
- Populated the database with working demo users

### 3. ✅ Working Demo Accounts
All demo accounts now work with proper authentication:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | admin@homework.com | admin123 |
| Teacher | teacher@homework.com | teacher123 |
| Student | student@homework.com | student123 |
| Parent | parent@homework.com | parent123 |
| Teacher | sarah.teacher@homework.com | teacher123 |
| Student | alex.student@homework.com | student123 |
| Student | sophia.student@homework.com | student123 |

### 4. ✅ Database Schema Issues
**Problem**: Foreign key constraints prevented cleanup of existing data.

**Solution**: Created a proper cleanup script that:
- Temporarily disables foreign key checks
- Cleans up data in the correct order (child tables first)
- Re-enables foreign key checks
- Populates with working data

### 5. ✅ QuillBot Extension Errors
**Problem**: Browser extension errors were cluttering the console.

**Note**: These are browser extension errors, not application errors. They don't affect the application functionality.

## Current Status

✅ **Backend**: Running on port 8080 with working authentication
✅ **Frontend**: Running on port 3000 with proper favicon
✅ **Database**: Populated with working demo users
✅ **Authentication**: All endpoints working correctly
✅ **CORS**: Properly configured for local development

## How to Test

1. **Backend**: Already running on http://localhost:8080
2. **Frontend**: Already running on http://localhost:3000
3. **Login**: Use any of the demo accounts above
4. **Test Flow**: 
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Use teacher@homework.com / teacher123
   - Should redirect to teacher dashboard

## Files Modified/Created

- `frontend/public/vite.svg` - Added missing favicon
- `database/cleanup_and_populate.sql` - Created working demo data
- `database/demo_users_corrected.sql` - Created corrected demo users
- `ISSUES_FIXED.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application** using the demo accounts
2. **Verify all features** work as expected
3. **Check for any remaining issues** in the browser console
4. **Consider adding more demo data** if needed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check backend logs**: Look for any error messages
2. **Verify database connection**: Ensure MySQL is running
3. **Check frontend console**: Look for any JavaScript errors
4. **Test authentication endpoints**: Use the test script if needed

## Security Notes

- Demo passwords are simple for testing purposes
- In production, use strong, unique passwords
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- All sensitive endpoints require proper authentication
