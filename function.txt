Objective
The system aims to:
1. Streamline Homework Management
− Create a unified digital platform to replace fragmented communication methods (paper, WhatsApp, email) for assigning, submitting, and tracking homework.
− This eliminates lost assignments and reduces administrative overhead for teachers while giving parents real-time visibility.
 
2. Enhance Accessibility for Young Learners
− Enable voice/photo submissions to accommodate primary students' limited typing skills.
− Ensures equitable participation regardless of literacy level or tech access.
 
3. Automated Progress Tracking
− Provide real-time dashboards showing completion status, grades, and teacher feedback
− Eliminates manual progress tracking efforts
 
4. Boost Engagement Through Gamification
− Implement a reward system (badges/points) for on-time submissions to motivate consistent participation.
− Addresses Sri Lanka's 42% homework non-completion rate by making tasks interactive.
 
5. School-Home Communication Hub
− Integrate event calendars, reminders and performance reports in one platform
− Streamlines parent-teacher communication (reducing missed meetings by 30% as per your pilot data)
 
Solutions
The system addressed here fulfills these needs by:
Unified Homework Management Platform
− Role-specific dashboards for teachers (assignment creation), parents (progress tracking), and admins (user management)
− Centralized repository for all homework materials (PDFs, videos, worksheets) with subject-wise categorization

Gamified Motivation System
− Point-based rewards for on-time submissions
− Tiered badges (Bronze/Silver/Gold) based on consistency
 
Integrated Communication Tools
