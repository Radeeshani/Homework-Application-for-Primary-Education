# 🧪 Homework-Class Relationship Feature - Test Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

The homework-class relationship feature is **100% complete** and ready for testing! Here's what you can now do:

### 🔧 Backend Features
- ✅ Database structure with `homework_class_assignments` table
- ✅ Updated `Homework` entity with `classId` field
- ✅ New `ClassEnrollmentService` for proper student filtering
- ✅ Updated `HomeworkService` to handle class assignments
- ✅ New repository methods for class-based filtering

### 🎨 Frontend Features  
- ✅ Updated `CreateHomework` component with class selection
- ✅ Teacher can only see their assigned classes
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ Proper form reset after submission

## 🚀 How to Test the Complete Workflow

### 1. **Test Teacher Class Selection**
1. **Login as a Teacher** (e.g., `teacher@homework.com`)
2. **Navigate to**: `http://localhost:3000/create-homework`
3. **Verify**: The "Class" dropdown shows only your assigned classes
4. **Expected**: You should see classes like:
   - "Science Discovery - Grade 5 (Science)"
   - "Test Class - Grade 3 (Science)"

### 2. **Test Homework Creation with Class Assignment**
1. **Fill out the form**:
   - Title: "Test Homework with Class Assignment"
   - Description: "This homework is assigned to a specific class"
   - Subject: "Science"
   - **Class**: Select one of your assigned classes
   - Due Date: Set a future date
2. **Submit the form**
3. **Expected**: Success message and redirect to teacher dashboard

### 3. **Test Student Homework Filtering**
1. **Login as a Student** (e.g., `student@homework.com` - 3rd Grade)
2. **Navigate to**: `http://localhost:3000/student` or homework list
3. **Expected**: Should see 5 homework assignments (all 3rd grade)
4. **Login as different grade student** (e.g., `alex.student@homework.com` - 4th Grade)
5. **Expected**: Should see only 1 homework assignment (4th grade)

### 4. **Verify Database Relationships**
The system automatically creates these relationships:
- ✅ Homework → Class (via `class_id`)
- ✅ Homework ↔ Class (many-to-many via `homework_class_assignments`)

## 📊 Current Data Status

### Existing Homework-Class Assignments:
- **3rd Grade**: 5 homework assignments → "Test Class"
- **4th Grade**: 1 homework assignment → "Final Test Class"  
- **5th Grade**: 3 homework assignments → "Science Discovery"

### Student Distribution:
- **3rd Grade**: 2 students (Emma, Sophia)
- **4th Grade**: 1 student (Alex)
- **5th Grade**: 1 student (test one)

## 🔍 API Endpoints to Test

### Teacher Classes:
```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/api/homework/classes/teacher/{teacherId}
```

### Student Homework (requires auth):
```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/api/homework/student
```

### Create Homework (requires auth):
```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/api/homework
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

✅ **Teachers**: Can only create homework for their assigned classes
✅ **Students**: Only see homework for their grade level/classes
✅ **Data Isolation**: Homework is properly segregated by class
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `class_grade` system still works

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If you see "No classes assigned":
- Contact an administrator to get assigned to classes
- Verify your teacher account has proper permissions

### If homework doesn't appear for students:
- Check that the student's `class_grade` matches the class's `grade_level`
- Verify the homework was created with a valid `class_id`

### If backend won't start:
- Ensure MySQL is running on port 3306
- Check database credentials in `application.yml`
- Verify all dependencies are installed

## 🎉 Success Indicators

The feature is working correctly when:
1. ✅ Teacher sees only their classes in the dropdown
2. ✅ Homework creation succeeds with class assignment
3. ✅ Students only see relevant homework
4. ✅ Database shows proper homework-class relationships
5. ✅ No cross-grade homework leakage
